Starting JQuery Repo
quiz friday:
one question is - first function u use in jquery: $(document).ready(function(){
gets data/ grants access to linked data - val
html - displays all the code inside of a "div" or "p" tag
text - shows text inside of a "div" or "p" tag

=== - equal value and equal type/ used for strings/text - go through every part of the data so its exactly the same
&& - and
== - used for numbers - only goes so deep that it doesn't check that much


do javascript unit test using jquery instead of javascript - project
